The name of my package is remPackage and it is titled as "Tool that Helps You Express Your Love for Football". Its version is 0.1 and the author and maintainer is Jeremy Iyonawan (myself). As for the description, the package allows you express your love for football. The package is utilizing a  GNU GPLv3 license which allows people do anything on the project. Finally, encoding is UTF-8 and LazyData is true, which makes my package a better citizen with respect to memory.

The process of creating my R markdown file was easy for me. I created the markdown file in html document format and titled it "Rem". By default, my markdown file consists of the r code: summary(cars) and a graph plot on pressure. Additionally, "echo = FALSE" parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated a plot. Overall, the process of creating an R markdown file was  fun to engage in.

I created a simple function which helps you express your love for football. The argument is "love" followed by the question: "Do you love football?" which defaults to "TRUE". The example for usage is "football_function()".
